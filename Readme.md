# üéÆ Xbox Game Pass Scraper

<!-- ![Project Image](link/to/image.png) -->

## ‚≠ê About

The "Xbox Game Pass Scraper" project is a web scraping tool that utilizes Puppeteer.js to extract game data from the official Xbox Game Pass website ([Xbox Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-IN/xbox-game-pass/games)). It gathers information about the games available on Xbox Game Pass, including their names, descriptions, platform compatibility, multiplayer status, ratings, prices, and more.

The scraped data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database, and a RESTful API is created using Node.js and Express.js to provide access to this data. The API allows users to query information about the games available on Xbox Game Pass, facilitating integration with other applications and services.

The project aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to access Xbox Game Pass game data programmatically, enabling developers to build applications, analyze trends, and enhance user experiences related to Xbox Game Pass.
